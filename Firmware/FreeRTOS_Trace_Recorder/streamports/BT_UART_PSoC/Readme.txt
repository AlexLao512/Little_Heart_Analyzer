***MODIFIED FOR PSOC***

This folder contain files needed for implementing streaming over a USB CDC interface.
It has been tested on a STM32F767ZI device on a Nucleus board.
This example uses files generated by STM32Cube FW_F7 V1.4.1. 
Using another USB stack or UART will require rewriting the files in this folder and subfolders.

Macros defined in trcStreamingPort.h use functions defined in trcStreamingPort.c that in its turn use functions defined in the USB-stack, so when using a similar USB stack it is probably only the c-file that will need rewriting.
